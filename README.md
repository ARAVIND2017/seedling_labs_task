# 🚀 AI Powered GitHub Issue Assistant

AI Powered GitHub Issue Assistant is a web application that helps developers quickly understand GitHub issues using Artificial Intelligence. Instead of manually reading long issue descriptions and comments, users can simply enter a GitHub repository URL and issue number to receive a clear summary, priority analysis, suggested labels, and potential impact.

The application uses a FastAPI backend to fetch issue details and comments from the GitHub REST API. The collected data is processed using a Groq AI model to generate structured insights. A professional Streamlit interface allows users to interact with the system easily and view both human-readable summaries and raw JSON outputs.
